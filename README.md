# ARISE

So you have an important event at 9AM in the morning, but you want to get up early, so you set your alarm clock at 8. However,
when the alarm rings, you're like "blargh, I still get an hour", and sleep in, completely defeating your original intentions
of waking up earlier.

If you've ever went through this, ARISE is the solution. When you set an alarm, you can set a range of when the alarm will ring,
and ARISE will ring at a randomized time between the time ranges, so you never know when the alarm is so you can get up much
easier :)
